### Preprocessing Folder

## About This Project

### Folders
- **data**: This contains the original datasets which haven't had any processing done
- **dataset_inspection_results**: This contains the cleaned datasets along with an inspection file which gives a brief overview of the data and ReadMe which go into detail about each dataset and how they were cleaned. 

### Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Gather and process historical climate data from reputable sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data integrity through thorough cleaning and preprocessing.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning Process**: Comprehensive steps to handle missing values and ensure data accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

  - NOTE: Due to the eruption of the Mauna Loa Volcano, measurements from Mauna Loa Observatory were suspended as of Nov. 29, 2022, and resumed in July 2023. Observations starting from December 2022 to July 4, 2023, are from a site at the Maunakea Observatories, approximately 21 miles north of the Mauna Loa Observatory.
